I know its not that big of a deal, I chose to have github as an outlet for my creative mind.  It is great also as a creative canvas

I just configured my sync for Visual Studio Code Desktop to my Github.  It has been a wild adventure. I have been learning more and more each day.  The more I figure out the problem the easier this computer science gets.
My favorite OS's are Kali Linux and Ubuntu Desktop and Server

When you use github, you can download your entire repository from the internet to a zip file.
Then extract that file on computer or other device.
