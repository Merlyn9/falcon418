I know its not that big of a deal, I chose to have github as an outlet for my creative mind.   I used to hide and hoard my thoughts, and now I want to share.

I just figured out how to sync my visual Studio Code App to my Github.  I knew how to do it before, I just had to set aside some time for it.  I have been learning more and more each day.  The more I figure out the problem the easier this computer science gets.
