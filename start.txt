How to stay secure


So I have a bad habit of reloading my OS every other week.
Really and truthfully everybody should, also do a clean install of new OS.
So I bounce back and forth on the most recent versions of Ubuntu and Kali Linux
I wrote scripts to run and install all of my "dependencies", so the down time 
between OS's was minimal.  It worked, I just got together all of the basic tools
I use and wrote them into a bash script. Each time I switch there are issues.
But I can mention them as they come up. 
 So if you cycle user accounts and passwords you can break links that a hacker can
  get at you with through the web.  I like to use Kali Linux, Ubuntu Desktop, and Ubuntu Server, 
  the most up to date versions if at all possible.

  I also use 2 flash writers, Balena Etcher and Raspberry Pi Imager.  I use Raspberry Pi Imager when I 
  can't open Balena Etcher when I am in Kali Linux.
  I put both operating systems on my Raspberry Pi, my two laptops, and a couple of towers I have laying around.
  Sometimes there is a little friction when I change, the trade off is that every issue I learn a new fix.
  Google is there for me and that is the best way thus far to find answers to problems you don't know.
  All developers use google.

  So in order to keep the down-time to a minimum I wrote a script to install all of my tools everytime I switched the OS.

  The first thing after installing a new OS every single time is an update and upgrade.
  I like Nmap, Git, VS Code, wireshark, htop, gnome-boxes, rpi-imager, net-tools, macchanger, cmatrix, shotcut and lynis.  Just to name a few.
  If there are programs that my be added with snap for Ubuntu, I like to add them with snap if I can.
