How to stay secure


So I have a bad habit of reloading my OS every other week.
Really and truthfully everybody should, also do a clean install of new OS.
So I bounce back and forth on the most recent versions of Ubuntu and Kali Linux
I wrote scripts to run and install all of my "dependencies", so the down time 
between OS's was minimal.  It worked, I just got together all of the basic tools
I use and wrote them into a bash script. Each time I switch there are issues.
But I can mention them as they come up. 
 So if you cycle user accounts and passwords you can break links that a hacker can
  get at you with through the web.  I like to use Kali Linux, Ubuntu Desktop, and Ubuntu Server, 
  the most up to date versions if at all possible.

  I also use 2 flash writers, Balena Etcher and Raspberry Pi Imager.  I use Raspberry Pi Imager when I 
  can't open Balena Etcher when I am in Kali Linux.
  I put both operating systems on my Raspberry Pi, my two laptops, and a couple of towers I have laying around.
  Sometimes there is a little friction when I change, the trade off is that every issue I learn a new fix.
  Google is there for me and that is the best way thus far to find answers to problems you don't know.
  All developers use google.
