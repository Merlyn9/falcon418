How to stay secure


So I have a bad habit of reloading my OS every other week.
Really and truthfully everybody should.  
So I bounce back and forth on the most recent versions of Ubuntu and Kali Linux
I wrote scripts to run and install all of my "dependencies", so the down time 
between OS's was minimal.  It worked, I just got together all of the basic tools
I use and wrote them into a bash script. Each time I switch there are issues.
But I can mention them as they come up. 
Hear about it here then watch the video on youtube.
