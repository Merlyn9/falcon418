I chose to work with Linux, Apache, postgreSQL and Python, only becasue 
I saw there was an oppurtunity for Python. 
 I am big on Linux since I started playing around with it 4 years ago.
 Its my favorite, it has so many flavors of distrobution and is widely used.
 It is also open source, which make it free.  I have tried to do all my developer stuff
 as free as I can. There is alot out there.  You just have to find it.
