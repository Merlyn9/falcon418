#I have started this github repo not only to capture my work, but to build a corpus of work I could present from if I so needed.
I have many ideas spinning in my head, and its easy to get confused, so running my ideas into a version control software is gonna do great.
I can see my ideas come to life.spin up a couple servers if I must.  I dont't know why I didn't think of it sooner.

#I think its great great idea to sanitize your desktop every fortnight. I keep all of my important things on a removable HardDrive with a capacity of 2TB.
it works out and as long as I use linux, nothing special to access my data.  I use Kali Linux and Ubuntu Desktop or server.  
With the security in mind to harden the system better each time you reset it. I am using Lynis and watching the reports to
 better the system.  Lynis is a great tool for the cybersecurity arena.

#I can create bash scripts to help speed the process along. Called automation can drastically reduce down-time.  
You could also write bash scripts to fill in databases, lists, and the list goes on.  Scripts are amazing when using Nmap,
there are so many combinations to use to apply on any IP address.  JavaScript is also a viable option for full stack. Mixed Reviews.
certain functions could possibly just a series of bash scripts if one wished.

#I would love to start this success off with strong goals. I want to write a book, and I want to code a game.
I beleive it would be outstanding in my portfolio. Also great experience I could maybe write a video about.

#When I started my tech journey, I knew it wasn't going to be easy.  I understood I would have alot of competition.
I know right now I am not the best.  But I have a passion to be number 1.  I know that if I perservere, I can be the developer
everybody wants.  Proper motivation, right attitude, and special eye for presentation will allow anybody to succeed.

# Refreshing on certain topics is never a bad idea. I heard someone say that Go is one of the easiest languages to learn. I want to 
 learn it I am doing a deep dive into backend, and I truly want to use a code base I could learn from.  As we start our journey I 
 learned that it is a best practice to annotate your code base.  So in honor of that I am notating everything I commit. Furthermore, 
 I will be notating my cose as I build it. Encouraging others as I do so. So that newcomers to the field may pick up a great habit. 

 #Ok, so the company i work for needs an app for the website. I am going to see if I can't bang one out of JavaScript. See how it goes, stay tuned for how it went.

##So i stumbled onto Golang. It proclaims to be the easiest language to learn, and boasts easiest to work with.  So I am going to give it a test run. I have worked with javascript, and python in the past. Iwo der how different Go is. It also pro.otes its own ecosystem. which should be nice.
I also read that it is most popular in getting hired. So alot of people are looking ti hire for it.

#As I go further in my journey in tech, with pitfalls come rewards. I have learned so by trying to put together components and putting components together. Learning how it all works. From the databases to API's. Its an amazong ride.

##Learning to code is an elite skill, it has many benefits.  You can learn for a long time and be a mid level dev, and have a better chance.  Take your time and assemble your portfolio. Turn out some work on github. You can have a website or two, maybe a couple of virtual servers on a cloud somewhere. Be ready to always do something amazing. Learn a coupke different programming languages.

# What you might lack in work experience you can showcase in portfolio.  Think about full stack web application. Build components and put things together.

# So I basically put together a fullstack website, and use tools and different languages to see what is the easiest more funtional. All in the name of experience.
LAMP, LAPP, MERN, and pure Javascript or Python, Or you can use Golang in the back end.  All & all you we are getting experience.

# I currently have a pet project in which i have a migration to a new database. I wanna clone my companys website and run it cheaper the way they want it to run. Also add so.e fuctions they did not have previous. Its going to be great. Stay tuned.

#I discovered coreutils for linux, and O have been using some hut not exactly the better ones. So I was going to deep dive and research the best utils to use. I saw a video where a guy made a tier list of the the linux coreutils.  It was an informative video.

# I have an oppurtunity coming up to help out with Linux Admin. I know Linux pretty good, I switched a couple year back. I believe in myself to help other get started in the OS with out confusing them. I can write little programs to make it easier for other to use the software. With out the shadow of the unknown cloud  over them.  This is a labor of love to me,  I love to learn and learn how it may help others, then share with them so they may go and do.  Circle of Life I guess.

#I just saw a video the gang of 4, they wfote a book about 23 programming design patterns that developers use in programming. If you are reading this because maybe you want to write code. You must read this book.

# There are alot of rabbit holes in tech you could go down.  The best advice is to niche in a technology. Databses, Linux, Cloud, are all great avenues. Pick one and double down.
