#I have started this github repo not only to capture my work, but to build a corpus of work I could present from if I so needed.
I have many ideas spinning in my head, and its easy to get confused, so running my ideas into a version control software is gonna do great.
I can see my ideas come to life.spin up a couple servers if I must.  I dont't know why I didn't think of it sooner.

#I think its great great idea to sanitize your desktop every fortnight. I keep all of my important things on a removable HardDrive with a capacity of 2TB.
it works out and as long as I use linux, nothing special to access my data.  I use Kali Linux and Ubuntu Desktop or server.  With the security in mind to harden the system better each time you reset it. I am using Lynis and watching the reports to better the system.  Lynis is a great tool for the cybersecurity arena.
