# New Log Cycle:
# So I have been tasked with being a Linux Administraitor, and my newest user is switching from Windows.  He has never used Linux,
and I want to help him transition easily. I am going to write some bash scripts for him, to automate certain tasks.  So he doesn't
have to traverse the file system yet, seeing as he is new.  I can make these shortcuts for him, and eventually he will go and discover 
on his own.  He is an elderly gentleman and doesn't want to get confused.  So I can make cron jobs do there things and run bash scripts 
at certain times of the day to take care of needed tasks to run and maintain any computer.  He is running Ubuntu's Latest Noble Nombat,
very beginner friendly. I use a program called Lynis to go over system hardening procedure with a fine tooth comb.  It does a very god job.
I think more people should check that out, it work on all platforms.
#I know PHP was al the rage back in the day, and I hear its making a come back. PHP looks alot easier than most scripting language models. I also found PHP has ways of writing code to be more secure.
#I also think learning OG PHP mught help me better learn a bit a history, or just better how to put it all together. Jokes on me, I should have started tech 15 years ago.
#I have actually fallen into a job working in the trades. I figure I can still study tech and attempt to produce in a youtube channel.  See where that goes, and use my knowledge in technology to solve problems the industry is facing. With better application, better websites, and more secure servers, apps, and websites. I currently work as an electrician. I am creating a few templates for an electrical company.  If I share these templates with other companies, they may want a website on that template. So it might prove to be an additional opportunity.
