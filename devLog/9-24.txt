# New Log Cycle:
# So I have been tasked with being a Linux Administraitor, and my newest user is switching from Windows.  He has never used Linux,
and I want to help him transition easily. I am going to write some bash scripts for him, to automate certain tasks.  So he doesn't
have to traverse the file system yet, seeing as he is new.  I can make these shortcuts for him, and eventually he will go and discover 
on his own.  He is an elderly gentleman and doesn't want to get confused.  So I can make cron jobs do there things and run bash scripts
at certain times of the day to take care of needed tasks to run and maintain any computer.  He is running Ubuntu's Latest Noble Nombat,
very beginner friendly. I use a program called Lynis to go over system hardening procedure with a fine tooth comb.  It does a very good job.
I think more people should check that out, it work on all platforms.
#I know PHP was al the rage back in the day, and I hear its making a come back. PHP looks alot easier than most scripting language models. I also found PHP has ways of writing code to be more secure.
#I also think learning OG PHP mught help me better learn a bit a history, or just better how to put it all together. Jokes on me, I should have started tech 15 years ago.
#I have actually fallen into a job working in the trades. I figure I can still study tech and attempt to produce in a youtube channel.  See where that goes, and use my knowledge in technology to solve problems the industry is facing. With better application, better websites, and more secure servers, apps, and websites. I currently work as an electrician. I am creating a few templates for an electrical company.  If I share these templates with other companies, they may want a website on that template. So it might prove to be an additional opportunity.
#Also with working as an electrician, the possibilities are endless. I would like to study for a while, attempt to get my journeymans.  It might prove valuable in the near future.  I also compiled a list of electric companies to cold call about websites and these templates I have. The templates are unique in that, some have a database attached to them. Others have just a static website, and another has a static website with PHP that alerts and emails.  All of these templates have different price points. Also all of these templates have different fuctions that require a level maintenance. Perhaps send an email or submit a form that inputs into a database.  Because I love cybersecurity, I want to make all of these templates secure enough so there are not any breaches like XSS, or hash and encrpyt certain tables in the database.  This is an idea to excite the ceeative process, and I think I can turn a decent profit. Plus I get to help somebody solve a problem. This is great.
#I wanted to discuss an easy method to learning to code. You can't start from zero, you need a codebase to study.  This manuscript is the key to unlocking duture potential.  You must study books and watch tutorials going over web development in all its various stages.  You must also take notes, this is very important.  I the old days we shiuld have notates our code, but we did not. We as novices can create and develop our own codebase and notate it.
Practicing notation gets us in to a study pattern that will benefit for years to come.
So when we study we find components in the examples. We can take these examples and study how they function, how they work.  Collect the functions and components you like and store them on a document.  Notate the document properly. If you dont know, they have many tutorials on notation.
Collect the components and try to organize them according to HTML "Standards". Have several smaller documents if you can, that may have 1,2, or 3 components working together to be part of an idea you had to apply your new found knowledge. You can study different aspects of how web applications work and piece together asolid foundation. This foundation can be trimmed or added to. It can be a template you can change a little bit to form a new template. Perhaps with or with out a database.  Also with or without hashing and encryption. Ifs a very good idea to start now practicing web security. I am studying for security+, web security is a must. Even in projects that are of less importance.
