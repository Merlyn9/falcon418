# New Log Cycle:
# So I have been tasked with being a Linux Administraitor, and my newest user is switching from Windows.  He has never used Linux,
and I want to help him transition easily. I am going to write some bash scripts for him, to automate certain tasks.  So he doesn't
have to traverse the file system yet, seeing as he is new.  I can make these shortcuts for him, and eventually he will go and discover 
on his own.  He is an elderly gentleman and doesn't want to get confused.  So I can make cron jobs do there things and run bash scripts 
at certain times of the day to take care of needed tasks to run and maintain any computer.  He is running Ubuntu's Latest Noble Nombat,
very beginner friendly. I use a program called Lynis to go over system hardening procedure with a fine tooth comb.  It does a very god job.
I think more people should check that out, it work on all platforms.
#I know PHP was al the rage back in the day, and I hear its making a come back. PHP looks alot easier than most scripting language models. I also found PHP has ways of writing code to be more secure.
